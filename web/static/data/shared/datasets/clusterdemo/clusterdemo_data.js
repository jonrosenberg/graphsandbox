                b: '::years ago, desperate for money, i sang a couple of Pink Floyd cover songs on top of muzak to pay off my credit card bill. The engineers told me that if i sang it like bjork they would let me do 2 tracks instead of 1, and since i was broke as a joke, i conceded. Now these hilariously embarrassing songs are on last.fm and i can\'t remove them cos that\'s how it works here. Wanna hear what i actually do? <a href="http://www.gigifrench.com" rel="nofollow">www.gigifrench.com</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gisellenumbaone" rel="nofollow">www.myspace.com/gisellenumbaone</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thehotsprings" rel="nofollow">www.myspace.com/thehotsprings</a>.',
